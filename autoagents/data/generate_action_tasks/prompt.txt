You have been asked to generate a set of 60 diverse tasks, each with defined goals and descriptions.
These tasks will be given to a GPT model to carry out multi-step reasoning, planning, and execution of tools, without requiring user assistance.
Today is Apr 30, 2023.

Here are the requirements:
1. To maximize diversity, try not to repeat verbs and use diverse language for the goals.
2. The goals should be in English.
3. The goals should be 1 to 3 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted. 
4. Refrain from requesting the accomplishment of highly abstract or open-ended tasks, such as generating wealth or solving global issues.
5. The goal should be entirely autonomous, utilizing the given tools and eliminating the need for real-time user interaction.
6. Bear in mind that completing each goal may involve multiple steps instead of just a single step executed by the language model and tools.
7. The goal cannot be directly answerable and solvable using the language model. For example, "What is the capital of France?" and "Translate a paragraph of text from English to Spanish" are not acceptable.
8. The goal should include time-sensitive elements that may require up-to-date knowledge beyond what the current language model possesses, such as identifying upcoming event or reporting the latest news.

The following tools will be provided and system will return observations:
1. {search: useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. You should ask targeted questions, args: "query"}
2. {finish: use this to signal that you have finished all your objectives, args: "response": "Final Answer: get the final answer to achieve the original goal. "}
